RiveScript-JS
=============

INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a RiveScript interpreter library for JavaScript.
RiveScript is a scripting language for chatterbots, making it
easy to write trigger/response pairs for building up a bot's
intelligence.

This library can be used both in a web browser or as a Node.JS
module.

It's still under active development; check back later.
